In this project, I fork the ethereum mainnet in real time using ganache and access the Dai contract, 
Then, access the account on mainnet having the most no. of dai, and transfer all the Dai from his account to a dummy account.
All this happens on a local mirror of the mainnet, that we have created using ganache.
